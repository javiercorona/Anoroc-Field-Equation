ðŸ“– Meaning:

Asymptotically Normalized Operator Relativistic Ontological Curvature

	â€¢	Asymptotically Normalized:
The equation recovers General Relativity in the low-curvature limit (i.e., when K \to 0, fâ€™(K) \to 0)
â†’ Just like Einsteinâ€™s GR, but with bounded high-curvature behavior.
	â€¢	Operator:
Refers to the differential structure of the added terms (e.g., \mathcal{H}_{\mu\nu}, involving â–¡, âˆ‡âˆ‡, etc.)
	â€¢	Relativistic Ontological Curvature:
	â€¢	Relativistic: Itâ€™s covariant, obeys Einsteinâ€™s principle
	â€¢	Ontological: It encodes deeper quantum/topological feedback
	â€¢	Curvature: Describes a bounded, regularized spacetime geometry
